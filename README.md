Annyeong-Haseyo! ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic second year student in the Higher Degree of Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) at IES VelÃ¡zquez. Since I started exploring the world of programming, I have been deeply attracted to the process of creating innovative and functional technological solutions.

I have worked on several academic projects that have allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in the creation of useful and effective applications. One of these projects was Game of Life, a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life. These experiences have been possible thanks to the support and guidance of my professors and classmates, as well as my family and friends, who have been a constant source of inspiration and motivation.

I am a curious and proactive person, always looking for new opportunities to learn and improve my skills. I am passionate about keeping up with the latest technology trends and participating in industry conferences and events, where I can learn from experts and connect with other professionals.

My goal is to imbibe more knowledge and work in an environment that allows me to develop personally and professionally. I am looking for internship opportunities or entry-level jobs where I can apply my knowledge and continue to grow as a developer.
